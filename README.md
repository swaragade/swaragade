# Scribble Pad

#### What is this place about ?

This is my attempt of re-collecting all the scattered information while trying to structure it in a better way.

This is not a blog/tutorial/guide of any kind, but feel free to use anything from here.

Well, I could have made this thing private, but this is my way of sharing to the community  
I could make use of Medium, dev.to but again, this ain't a blog. This is a place where I dont care anymore about styling and structuring and visits on my page.

#### About me

I am a Software Engineer working majorly on modern web applications. I worked on multiple languages, frameworks, clouds, tools; so you will probably find a lot of random stuff here.   
With that said, my go to language has always been Java. I end up doing most of my stuff in Java.   
For scripting, I use shell for the most part, Python once a while.
