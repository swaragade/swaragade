# Maths

Count number of digits in a number = take log of that number and add 1. Take floor value of the result

```java
Math.floor(Math.log10(1234)+1) // no of digits in 1234 = 4 
```

#### Arithmetic Progression

a = first term  
d= difference

```java
n = a+ (n-1)d // n is nth term in the sequence
average = sum of all terms / n
therefor sum = avg * n

but avg =  (a + (nth term))/2

therefore,
sum = (n/2)*( 2a + (n-1)*d)

```
