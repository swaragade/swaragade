# Maths

Count number of digits in a number = take log of that number and add 1. Take floor value of the result

```java
Math.floor(Math.log10(1234)+1) // no of digits in 1234 = 4 
```

#### Arithmetic Progression

a = first term  
d= difference

```java
n = a+ (n-1)d // n is nth term in the sequence
average = sum of all terms / n
therefor sum = avg * n

but avg =  (a + (nth term))/2

therefore,
sum = (n/2)*( 2a + (n-1)*d)

```

#### Geometric Progression

```java
a = first term
r = ratio
n = ar^(n-1) // nth term
sum = a(1-r^n) / (1-r) // sum of series
```

$$
n = ar^n/r
$$

$$
sum of series = a(1-r^n)/(1-r)
$$

#### Quadratic Equation

$$
ax^2 + bx +c = 0
$$

$$
D =  b^2 - 4ac
$$

#### Mean

is average of all the terms i.e a+b+c/3

#### Mode

is the most repeating term

#### Median

is the physical center of the series when sorted.  
if there are 2 medians, then we take mean of those 2 numbers
